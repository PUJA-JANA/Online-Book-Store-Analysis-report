# üìö Online-Book-Store-Analysis-report

## ‚ú® Project Overview
This project analyzes sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management for an **online bookstore** using **SQL**. By leveraging structured queries, we extract valuable insights to help optimize book sales, customer engagement, and stock management.

## üîé Objectives
- Analyze **total revenue**, **best-selling books**, and **popular genres**.
- Identify **top customers** and their purchasing patterns.
- Track **yearly revenue trends** to optimize pricing and promotions.
- Detect **low-stock books** that need restocking.
- Understand **order trends** to improve sales strategies.

## üìö Dataset
The project uses three datasets:
1. **Books.csv** ‚Äì Contains book details (ID, Title, Author, Genre, Price, Stock, Published Year).
2. **Customers.csv** ‚Äì Stores customer information (ID, Name, City, Country, Email, Phone).
3. **Orders.csv** ‚Äì Includes transaction records (Order ID, Customer ID, Book ID, Order Date, Quantity, Total Amount).

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Queries
### **Sales & Revenue Analysis**
```sql
-- Total Revenue Generated
SELECT SUM(Total_Amount) AS Total_Revenue FROM Orders;
```
```sql
-- Most Popular Book
SELECT b.Title, SUM(o.Quantity) AS Total_Sales
FROM Orders o
JOIN Books b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY b.Title
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
```sql
-- Yearly Revenue Trend
SELECT YEAR(Order_Date) AS Year, SUM(Total_Amount) AS Total_Revenue
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year;
```

### **Customer Analysis**
```sql
-- Top 5 Customers by Spending
SELECT c.Name, SUM(o.Total_Amount) AS Total_Spending
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY Total_Spending DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
```sql
-- Most Active Customer
SELECT c.Name, COUNT(o.Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## ‚ú® Key Insights
